        <h3>chess</h3>
        <p>Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance.<br> 
            It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.<br> 
            The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.<br>
             White moves first, followed by Black.<br>
              The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture.<br>
               There are several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
